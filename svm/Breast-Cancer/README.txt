This folder contains the breast cancer classification data set drawn from the UCI Machine Learning repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer). In the data files provided, each row is a separate training example; the first 9 columns correspond to features, while the last column is the label (+1/-1). 


Files:
train.mat - Training instances + labels (600 x 10)


Folders:
CrossValidation - contains the cross-validation data for each fold of the 5-fold cross-validation procedure on the training set. 

The cross-validation data has been generated using the following procedure: we divided the training data into 5 equal parts. For each fold cv_train contains 4 of the 5 parts and cv_test contains 1 left-out part. 

For doing cross-validation, you take each fold you and train on the cv_train, and the error for the fold would be calculated using cv_test. Select the parameters with the least average cross-validation error.

Note: You are not given test data for this dataset. You will have to upload your code in the autograder where we will test your accuracy against a private test set.
